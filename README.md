# MIPS_CPU (Work in ProgresðŸš¥)V1

## For simplicty version 1 will be non-pipelined and it assumes a single block of memory 

### I started this project because I wanted to put to use some of the things that I learned from my computer organization class. I used the book "Computer Organization and Design - The Hardware/Software Interface, David Patterson and John Hennessy, Fifth Edition (MIPS edition)"

For some implementations I ended up copying some code from the book and I intend to claim no propriety over it.
