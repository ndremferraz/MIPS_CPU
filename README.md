# MIPS_CPU (Work in Progres ðŸš¥)

## I started this project because I wanted to put to use some of the things that I learned from my computer organization class

### I used the book "Computer Organization and Design - The Hardware/Software Interface, David Patterson and John Hennessy, Fifth Edition (MIPS edition)"

For some implementations I ended up copying some code for the book and I intend to claim no propriety over it.
